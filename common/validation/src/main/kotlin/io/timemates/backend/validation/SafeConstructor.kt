/**
 * Abstraction for factories that construct value objects.
 * Next pattern should be applied to the factories:
 * - Factory should be in companion object that does only one thing â€“ constructing.
 * - Validation information (like sizes or patterns) should be on the top of
 * the factories in order to better readability.
 * - After validation information comes [create] and, if needed, constants
 * with messages below the method.
 *
 * This is abstract class on purpose: to support clearness and readability of
 * value objects.
 *
 * **You should always implement a constructor for value objects, even if
 * there is no actual restrictions on given type. It will help to minimize
 * possible changes and support existing code style rules.**
